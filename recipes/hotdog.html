    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Indulge in the savory delight of a classic hotdog, where simplicity meets satisfaction in every bite. Begin with plump, juicy sausages, carefully grilled to perfection until they boast a tantalizing charred exterior, locking in their succulent flavors. Nestled within a soft, toasted bun, these sizzling sausages await a cascade of toppings.</p>
    <p>Generously drizzle tangy mustard and creamy mayonnaise, followed by a sprinkling of diced onions for a punch of freshness. Finally, crown this culinary masterpiece with a scattering of crisp, golden-brown onions and a dash of zesty relish, completing a symphony of flavors that dance harmoniously on the palate.</p>
