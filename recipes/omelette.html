    <h1>Delicious Omelette</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Omelette, a versatile dish beloved across cultures, is a canvas for culinary creativity. Begin by whisking eggs in a bowl, incorporating air for a fluffy texture. Add a dash of milk for creaminess and a pinch of salt and pepper for seasoning. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and melt butter for richness. Pour in the egg mixture, allowing it to spread evenly across the pan. As the edges begin to set, gently lift and tilt the pan, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges, ensuring an even cook. Sprinkle fillings of choice—be it cheese, diced vegetables, or savory meats—across the surface. Once the bottom is golden and the center is just set, fold the omelette in half with a spatula, creating a crescent shape. Slide it onto a plate, garnishing with fresh herbs for a burst of color and flavor.</p>
    <p>The beauty of the omelette lies in its adaptability. From the classic French finesse of a simple fines herbes omelette to the hearty Spanish tortilla packed with potatoes and onions, the variations are endless. Experiment with different fillings and toppings to tailor the omelette to your taste. Serve it alongside a crisp green salad for a light brunch or with crusty bread for a satisfying meal any time of day. Whether enjoyed as a quick weekday breakfast or a leisurely weekend brunch, the omelette is a timeless culinary delight, offering comfort and nourishment in every bite.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large fresh eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cold water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne or white pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Whisk until mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, 1 or 2 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. As soon as butter melts and before it starts to sizzle, pour in whisked eggs. Stir in a circular pattern with a heat-proof spatula, lifting and scrambling eggs, shaking the pan to keep leveling out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. Continue stirring until shaking the pan no longer levels the eggs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface to move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness. As soon as the surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Starting at the handle side of the pan, use the spatula to begin rolling omelette into a cylinder shape, about 3 rolls until omelette is about 2 inches from opposite side of the pan. Use the spatula to fold the last flap of egg over the top of the cylinder leaving the seam-side up. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to the pan. Gently push the butter as it melts under the omelette.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Slide omelette to edge of the pan. Flip onto a plate with the seam-side down. Even out the shape, if necessary. You can tuck in the ends, if you like. Brush surface with a bit more butter. Dust with cayenne pepper.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
